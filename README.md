# Discord bot 'Legion'
## by DaveMitHut

### Preface
I wrote this little discord bot for our own private server in april 2019.
It has some small basic functions relating to Magic: The Gathering and
Dungeons & Dragons. It is named after the character 'Legion' from the
Mass Effect games.

### Functions
This bot has only some small functions relating to **Magic: The Gathering** and
**Dungeons & Dragons** like displaying cards and rolling dice. The functions are
displayed in the following table:

Name | Alias | Function

!legality cardname | !legalities, !legal | displays the given mtg card's legalities for standard, modern & commander

### Additional functions
In addition to the specified functions above, this bot will also **greet all new
server members** with a specific message, swearing everlasting loyalty to its
creator and hwo to see all commands. Furthermore, if you start writing a command
with '!' and then **type an invalid command**, the bot will notify you and tell you
how to see all valid commands.
