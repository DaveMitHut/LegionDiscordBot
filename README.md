# Discord bot 'Legion'
## by DaveMitHut

### Preface
I wrote this little discord bot for our own private server in april 2019.
In April 2020, we moved this bot to the server for our streaming Community,
"Helden Auf Papier".

The bot has small basic functions related to *Magic: The Gathering*, *Dungeons
& Dragons* and general RPGs. It is named after the character 'Legion' from the
Mass Effect games.

### Functions
This bot has some small functions related to *Magic: The Gathering*,
*Dungeons & Dragons* and other RPGs like displaying cards and rolling dice. The
functions are displayed in the following table:

**Name** | **Other Aliases** | **Function**

### Additional functions
In addition to the specified functions above, this bot will also **greet all new
server members** with a specific message and information on how to view all available
commands. Furthermore, the bot will grant specific permissions to every new member of
the server. If you type an invalid command, the bot will notify you and instruct you
how to view all valid commands.
